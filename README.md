# MiniTip
MiniTip is a free Bitcoin tipping service whose only interface is reddit.

Please note that this was a spontaneous project and as such, the code is not well-formed/documented nor the design immaculate, but it works.

for information on the service.

Private key encryption methods have been replaced by placeholders in the source to ensure the security of users' funds.

Elements of the coindust library were used to facilitate payments and address generation. You can view it here: https://github.com/donpdonp/coindust
